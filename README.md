## Problem Overview

### Objective

Build a tool that:

- Accepts NEM12 CSV files
- Parses valid metering data from the file
- Generates corresponding SQL INSERT statements
- Displays a preview of parsed data and resulting SQL

### Requirements

- Upload and parse large CSV files entirely on the client-side
- Handle data integrity and formatting
- Provide a clear UI for previewing and extracting results

### Technical objectives

- Provide a centralised suite of tools instead of building separate products for various purposes
- Create a skeletal scaffold for future development of other tools

| Tool                            | Why It Was Chosen                                                                                                  | Possible Cons                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React 18 + Vite                 | Fast dev environment, clean client-side architecture. React 18 for best test-compatibility, out of the box webpack | Limited customisations and functional support                                    |
| Tailwind CSS                    | Utility-first styling for rapid iteration, less files to handle and context switching                              | Learning curve for developers used to CSS, does not support all CSS capabilities |
| PapaParse                       | Efficient, performant CSV parsing                                                                                  | Requires understanding of API for advanced parsing functions                     |
| Vitest + Jest + Testing Library | Ensures components and logic are tested                                                                            |

## File Format Assumptions

### NEM12 Structure

The file contains hierarchical records:

- 100 record ‚Äì metadata header (one per file)
- 200 records ‚Äì NMI identifiers and interval configuration
- 300 records ‚Äì daily interval data (multiple per 200)
- 400 / 500 / 900 ‚Äì footer and other records

### Parsing Logic

Omit records 400 / 500 / 900, not needed for this function's purpose.

For each 200 record:

- Extract NMI and interval length (assumed at index -2)
- For each associated 300 record:
  - Parse the interval date
  - Extract consumption values (according to interval length
    - e.g. length = 30 - 1440 / 30 = 48 interval values)
  - For each timestamp, generate an INSERT with:
    - NMI
    - Timestamp (computed from date + interval index)
    - Consumption (Sum of all the values in range, rounded to 4 d.p.)

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Feature-Sliced Architecture

The project follows a feature-sliced modular architecture, which organizes code by feature rather than technical type. This improves scalability, readability, and collaboration by keeping related logic close together.

```

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Uploader/           # File upload UI and logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NavBar/             # Top navigation bar

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx                 # Main application entry and layout

```

### Test Design

Test files are colocated with the components they test. This approach promotes:

- Better context and readability

- Faster navigation and iteration

- Scalability as the codebase grows

Each feature or component has its test logic nearby, ensuring changes are easier to verify and maintain.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ Upload NEM12 CSV files (large file support)
- ‚úÖ Efficient parsing with PapaParse streaming
- ‚úÖ SQL generation for meter_readings table
- ‚úÖ Preview and toggle between raw and parsed data
- ‚úÖ Clean, minimal interface with Tailwind
- ‚úÖ Moderate test coverage for core components and logic

### Secondary Features

- Process multiple files quickly by removing uploaded files to upload other files
- Support for data sets with other data intervals besides `30`
- Conveniently copy SQL Insert statements or export in an `.sql` file

## Assumptions Made

| Assumption                                                               | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Each file contains a single 100 header                                   | NEM12 standard format; observed pattern in sample data                                                                                                           |
| Fields like QualityMethod, ReasonCode, and ReasonDescription are ignored | Inconsistent presence across data; not required for SQL generation. High complexity involved in parsing each type of data due to optional fields in NEM12 format |
| Interval Length is extracted from the second-last index of 200 records   | Handles cases with missing optional fields                                                                                                                       |
| Duplicate NMI + timestamp pairs are allowed (aggregated if needed)       | To avoid conflicts with SQL unique constraints                                                                                                                   |

## Possible Improvements

| Area             | Suggestion                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability      | Move parsing to Web Worker or Node.js service for very large files                                                                           |
| UI               | Add drag-and-drop support, SQL download, virtualisation for very large data                                                                  |
| Validation       | Add schema validation and user feedback for malformed files, 'fill in the blanks' with cell specific validation                              |
| Failure Handling | Add more robust error handling, feedback for failed SQL generation, regenerate SQL inputs for conflicting values                             |
| Testing          | Add full E2E test coverage with mocked file inputs                                                                                           |
| Standardisation  | Chakra UI, Next.js and CSS modules instead for consistent tech stack with the public Flo website, for better maintainability and scalability |

## Testing Strategy

- Component rendering (e.g., Title, Table preview)
- File upload interaction tests
- CSV parsing logic unit tests
- SQL generation unit tests

## Final Notes

This project is built as a client-side internal tooling platform to handle meter reading file uploads and transform them into structured SQL insert statements. It‚Äôs optimized for clarity, performance, and extensibility.
